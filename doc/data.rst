Data, metadata, and configuration
*********************************

Many, varied kinds of data are used to prepare and modify MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM scenarios.
Other data are produced by code as incidental or final output.
These can be categorized in several ways.
One is by the purpose they serve:

- **data**—actual numerical values—used or produced by code,
- **metadata**, information describing where data is, how to manipulate it, how it is structured, etc.;
- **configuration** that otherwise affects how code works.

Another is whether they are **input** or **output** data.

This page describes how to store and handle such files in both :mod:`message_ix_models` and :mod:`message_data`.

   :local:


.. _data-goes-where:

Choose locations for data
=========================

These are listed in order of preference.

.. _package-data:

(1) :file:`message_ix_models/data/`
-----------------------------------

- Files in this directory are **public**, and are packaged, published, and installable from PyPI with :mod:`message_ix_models`; in standard Python terms, these are “package data”.
- This is the preferred location for:

  - General-purpose metadata.
  - Basic configuration, e.g. for reporting, not specific to any model variant or project.
  - Data for publicized model variants and completed/published projects.

- Data here can be loaded with :func:`.load_package_data` or other, more specialized code.
- Documentation files like :file:`doc/pkg-data/*.rst` describe the contents of these files.
  For example: :doc:`pkg-data/node`.

.. _private-data:

(2) :file:`data/` directory in the :mod:`message_data` repo
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Files in this directory are **private** and not installable from PyPI (because :mod:`message_data` is not installable).
- This is the preferred location for:

  - Data for model variants and projects under current development.
  - Specific data files that cannot be made public, e.g. due to licensing issues.

- Data here can be loaded with :func:`.load_private_data` or other, more specialized code.

.. _local-data:

(3) Other, system-specific (“local”) directories
------------------------------------------------

- These are the preferred location for:

  - Caches i.e. temporary data files used to speed up other code.
  - Output e.g. data or figure files generated by reporting.

- These kinds of data **should not** be committed to either :mod:`message_ix_models` or :mod:`message_data`.
- Each user **may** configure a location for these data, appropriate to their system.

  This setting can be made in multiple ways.
  In order of ascending precedence:

  1. The default location is the *current working directory*, i.e. whichever directory the :doc:`cli` is invoked in, or in which Python code is run that imports and uses :mod:`message_ix_models`.
  2. The :mod:`ixmp` configuration setting ``message local data``.
  3. The ``MESSAGE_LOCAL_DATA`` environment variable.
  4. The ``--local-data`` CLI option and related options such as ``--cache-path`` or the ``--output`` option to the ``report`` command.
  5. Code that directly modifies the ``local_data`` setting on :class:`.Context`.

  - This location **should** be outside the Git-controlled directories for :mod:`message_ix_models` or :mod:`message_data`.
    If not, use :file:`.gitignore` files to hide these from Git.


General guidelines
==================

Always consider: “Will this code work on another researcher's computer?”

Prefer text formats
   …such as e.g. CSV and YAML.
   CSV files up to several thousand lines are compressed by Git automatically, and Git can handle diffs to these files easily.

*Do not* hard-code paths
   Data stored with (1) or (2) above can be retrieved with the utility funtions mentioned, instead of hard-coded paths.

   For system-specific paths (3) only, get a :obj:`.Context` object and use it to get an appropriate :class:`.Path` object pointing to a file

   .. code-block:: python

       # Store a base path
       project_path = context.get_local_path("myproject", "output")

       # Use the Path object to generate a subpath
       run_id = "foo"
       output_file = project_path.joinpath("reporting", run_id, "all.xlsx")

Keep input and output data separate
   Use (1) or (2), above, for the format, and (3) for the latter.

Use a consistent scheme for data locations
   For a submodule for a specific model variant or project named, e.g. ``message_ix_models.model.[name]`` or ``message_ix_models.projects.[name]``, keep input data in a well-organized directory under :file:`[base]/model/[name]/`, :file:`[base]/project/[name]/`, or similar, where ``[base]`` is (1) or (2), above.

   Keep *project-specific configuration files* in the same locations, or (less preferable) alongside Python code files:

   .. code-block:: python

      # Located in `message_ix_models/data/`:
      config = load_package_data("myproject", "config.yaml")

      # Located in `data/` in the message_data repo:
      config = load_private_data("myproject", "config.yaml")

      # Located in the same directory as the code
      config = yaml.safe_load(open(Path(__file__).with_name("config.yaml")))

   Use a similar scheme for output data, except under (3).

Re-use configuration
   Configuration to run a set of scenarios or to prepare reported submissions **should** re-use or extend existing, general-purpose code.
   Do not duplicate code or configuration.
   Instea, adjust or selectively overwrite its behaviour via project-specific configuration read from a file.


.. _binary-input-data:

Large/binary input data
=======================

These data, such as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, **must not** be committed as ordinary Git objects.
This is because the entire file is re-added to the Git history for even small modifications, making it very large (see `issue #37 <https://github.com/iiasa/message_data/issues/37>`_).

Instead, use one of the following patterns, in order of preference.
Whichever pattern is used, code for handling large input data must be in :mod:`message_ix_models`, even if the data itself is private, e.g. in :mod:`message_data` or another location.

Fetch from a remote source
--------------------------

Use a configuration file in :mod:`message_ix_models` to store metadata, i.e. the Internet location and other information needed to retrieve the data.
Then, write code that retrieves the data and caches it locally:

.. code-block:: python

    import requests

    # Load some configuration
    config = yaml.safe_load(load_package_data("big-data-source", "config.yaml"))

    # Local paths for the cached raw files and extracted file(s)
    cache_path = context.get_cache_path("big-data-source")
    downloaded = cache_path / "downloaded_file.zip"
    extracted = cache_path / "extracted_file.csv"

    with open(downloaded) as f:
        remote_data = requests.get(config["url"])
        # Handle the data, writing to `f`

    # Extract the data from `downloaded` to `extracted`

This pattern is preferred because it can be replicated by anyone, and the reference data is public.

Use Git Large File Storage (LFS)
--------------------------------

`Git LFS <https://git-lfs.github.com/>`_ is a Git extension that allows for storing large, binary files without bloating the commit history.
Essentially, Git stores a one-line text file with a hash of the full file, and the full file is stored separately.
The IIASA GitHub account has up to 300 GB of space for LFS objects.

To use this pattern, simply ``git add ...`` and ``git commit`` files in an appropriate location (above).
New or unusual binary file extensions may require a ``git lfs`` command or modification to :file:`.gitattributes` to ensure they are tracked by LFS and not by ordinary Git history.
See the Git LFS documentation at the link above for more detail.


Retrieve data from existing databases
-------------------------------------

These include the same IIASA ENE ixmp databases that are used to store scenarios.
Documentation **must** be provided that ensures this data is reproducible, i.e. any original source and code to create the database used by :mod:`message_data`.


Other patterns
--------------

Some other patterns exist, but should not be repeated in new code, and should be migrated to one of the above patterns.

- SQL queries against a Oracle/JDBC database. See :ref:`data-iea`, below, and `issue #53 <https://github.com/iiasa/message_data/issues/53#issuecomment-669117393>`_ for a description of how to replace/simplify this code.


Configuration
=============

:class:`.Context` objects are used to carry configuration, environment information, and other data between parts of the code.
Scripts and user code can also store values in a Context object.

.. code-block:: python

    # Get an existing instance of Context. There is always at
    # least 1 instance available
    c = Context.get_instance()

    # Store a value using attribute syntax
    c.foo = 42

    # Store a value with spaces in the name using item syntax
    c["PROJECT data source"] = "Source A"

    # my_function() responds to 'foo' or 'PROJECT data source'
    my_function(c)

    # Store a sub-dictionary of values
    c["PROJECT2"] = {"setting A": 123, "setting B": 456}

    # Create a subcontext with all the settings of `c`
    c2 = deepcopy(c)

    # Modify one setting
    c2.foo = 43

    # Run code with this alternate setting
    my_function(c2)


For the CLI, every command decorated with ``@click.pass_obj`` gets a first positional argument ``context``, which is an instance of this class.
The settings are populated based on the command-line parameters given to ``mix-models`` or (sub)commands.
