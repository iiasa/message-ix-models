GEIDCO IV
=========
For "Phase IV", from 2022-09 to 2023-06:

Introduction
------------
The GEIDCO IV project aims to design and develop two contrasting scenarios: a Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario and the Global Energy Interconnection (GEI) 1.5°C scenario. 
Under the GEI 1.5°C scenario, the project analyzes global and regional pathways toward carbon peaking and carbon neutrality. 
This includes a detailed assessment of energy demand across regions, sub-sectors, and energy types, with a particular focus on end-use sectors such as industry, transport, and buildings.

A key component of the project is the comprehensive life cycle assessment of core technologies in the new power system, including photovoltaics, wind power, hydro power, ultra-high voltage (UHV) transmission, and energy storage. 
The study quantifies carbon emissions, energy consumption, and key resource requirements for these technologies at the end-use level. 
Furthermore, by integrating the GEI carbon neutrality scenario, the project estimates global installed capacities for photovoltaics, wind power, hydro power, UHV transmission expansion, and energy storage deployment. 
This enables an in-depth evaluation of the carbon and resource footprints of these technologies while considering the geographic distribution of critical resources needed for achieving global carbon neutrality.
