“Bridging current knowledge gaps to enable the UPTAKE of carbon dioxide removal methods”

UPTAKE aims to carry out a systemic and integrated appraisal
of a large portfolio of CDR methods
and their interactions with decarbonization and sustainability strategies.

Project information
===================

- Website: https://cdr-uptake.eu
- Duration: 2023-06–2027-05.
- Funders: Horizon Europe, UK Research & Innovation, CH government

Activities include:

Task 1.4 (non-modeling)
   Scenario Explorer with spatial maps
   and regional policy and feasibility infographics.

Work Package 3 (IIASA co-leading)
   Tasks 2.6/3.13.2
      Full update of regional CDR costs, potentials,
      and other sustainablity limits for all CDR methods.

   Task 3.3
      Implement changes in CDR effectiveness from climate feedbacks
      (link to RESCUE project).
      Involves model intercomparison.

   Task 3.4
      Systems integration and CDR:
      effect on electricity, land, and material scarcity.
      Involves model intercomparison.

   Task 3.5
      Regional dynamics & 'fair' CDR pathways:
      effect of regional limitations, institutional feasibility, and equity
      on carbon removals in net-zero CO2 and GHG scenarios.
      Involves model intercomparison.

Work Package 5
   Task 5.2
      Politically constrained pathways:
      pathways exploring political feasibility
      of market and regulatory regimes for CDR.
      Involves model intercomparison.

   Task 5.3
      Sustainability and CDR:
      synergies and tradeoffs of CDR with SDGs.
      Involves model intercomparison.
