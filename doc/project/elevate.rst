WP2 Evaluation of NDCs and current policies and implications for future post-2030 policies
==========================================================================================
- Lead modeler (as of 2025-01): :gh-user:`yiyi1991`

Scenario matrix
---------------

- ELV-SSP2-650P-400F: first priority a CO2 emissions peak budget of 650 GtCO2 (from 2020 to the time of net zero emissions), next try to reach a full century budget of 400 GtCO2 (from 2020–2100)
- ELV-SSP2-1150F: CO2 emissions budget of 1,150 GtCO2 from 2020 onwards (peak as well as full century budget)
- ELV-SSP2-CP-D0: Current Policies with constant carbon price after 2030/2040
- ELV-SSP2-NDC-D0: NDC with constant carbon price after 2030/2040 
- ELV-SSP2-NDC-LTS: consider the NDC pledges and the long-term strategy pledges (net-zero targets)
- ELV-SSP2-LTS: countries are on a cost-optimal pathway towards their net-zero targets without the need to meet their NDC pledges in 2030

Starting scenarios
------------------
NGFS phase 5 for 1st round submission, SSP2 v0.18 for 2nd round submission, 

Final submission will be based on the finalized SSP2 baseline scenarios. 

Scenario identifier
-------------------
(to be added by Spring 2026)

(on message-data repository, to be migrated to message-ix-models by Spring 2026)

WP4 International governance and policy FASTrack
================================================
- Lead modeler (as of 2025-01): :gh-user:`OFR-IIASA`

Scenario matrix
---------------

- Baseline: no import tax
- National Protectionism: imported emissions are taxed extra, at the same rate as the national carbon price
- Total Retaliation: imported emissions are taxed extra, at the maximum between the world average carbon price and the national carbon price
- Green Boost: collected import tax is used recycled as extra investment in green and low carbon energy technologies
- Technological Autarky: technical learning spillovers is switch off, regions learn only by their own

Starting scenarios
------------------
ENGAGE R11 baseline
