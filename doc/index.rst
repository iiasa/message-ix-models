Tools for MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM models
**********************************

:mod:`message_ix_models` provides tools for research using the **MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM family of models** developed by the IIASA Energy, Climate, and Environment (ECE) Program and its collaborators.
This ‘family’ includes single-country and other models derived from the main, global model; all built in the `MESSAGEix framework <https://docs.messageix.org>`_ and on the `ix modeling platform (ixmp) <https://docs.messageix.org/ixmp/>`_.

Among other tasks, the tools allow modelers to:

- retrieve input data from various upstream sources,
- process/transform upstream data into model input parameters,
- create, populate, modify, and parametrize scenarios,
- conduct model runs,
- set up model *variants* with additional details or features, and
- report quantities computed from model outputs.
