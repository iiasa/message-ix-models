What's new
**********

Next release
============

- :pull:`6`: Update :doc:`node codelists <pkg-data/node>` to ensure they contain both current and former ISO 3166 codes for countries that have changed status.
  For instance, ANT dissolved into BES, CUW, and SXM in 2010; all four are included in R11_LAM so this list can be used to handle data from either before or after 2010.

2021.2.26
=========

- :pull:`2`: Add :func:`.get_codes` and related code lists.
- :pull:`3`: Add :class:`.MessageDataFinder` and document :doc:`migrate`.

2021.2.23
=========

Initial release.
