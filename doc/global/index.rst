MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM global model
==============================

.. caution:: This section of the documentation is under revision
   on this branch.
   See :issue:`424` for details.

   Text on these pages may mix old and revised material;
   links may be broken;
   and in general these pages **should not** be used as reference
   until changes are reviewed and merged via :pull:`425`.

These pages document the IIASA Integrated Assessment Modeling (IAM) framework, also referred to as **MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM**, owing to the fact that the energy model |MESSAGEix| and the land use model GLOBIOM are its most important components.
|MESSAGEix|-GLOBIOM was developed for the quantification of the so-called Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) which are the first application of the IAM framework.

.. note:: The documentation in this section was originally available at https://docs.messageix.org/global/ and maintained in a separate repository at `iiasa/message_doc <https://github.com/iiasa/message_doc>`_.
   In the future, it will be maintained in `iiasa/message-ix-models <https://github.com/iiasa/message_doc>`_ and appear at the current URL.

   The overall :mod:`message_ix_models` documentation provides **technical** description of the Python package of the same name, associated data, and their usage for *all* models in the |MESSAGEix|-GLOBIOM ‘family’.
   This section provides a thorough **methodological** description of the particular, central, global-scope instance of |MESSAGEix|-GLOBIOM developed by the IIASA ECE Program, from which most other instances derive.

   This section is periodically updated and expanded with additional information to describe the current implementation and its changes over time.

|MESSAGEix|-GLOBIOM is based on the :doc:`message-ix:framework`, which provides a flexible, *generic* abstraction of energy systems optimization models that can be parametrized in many ways.
:mod:`message_ix` includes the ‘MACRO’ computable general equilibrium (CGE) for implementing macro-economic feedback.
To refer to the generic MESSAGE, MACRO, and combined models—rather than the particular |MESSAGEix|-GLOBIOM IAM instance or its specific applications for various publications and assessments—please follow the :ref:`“User guidelines and notice” section <message-ix:notice-cite>` of the :mod:`message_ix` documentation.
