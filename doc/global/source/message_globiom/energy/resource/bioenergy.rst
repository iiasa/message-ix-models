Biomass resources
======================
Biomass energy is another potentially important renewable energy resource in the MESSAGE-GLOBIOM model. This includes both commercial and non-commercial use. Commercial refers to the use of bioenergy in, for example, power plants or biofuel refineries, while non-commercial refers to the use of bioenergy for residential heating and cooking, primarily in rural households of today’s developing countries. Bioenergy potentials differ across SSPs as a result of different levels of competition over land for food and fibre, but ultimately only vary to a limited degree (:numref:`fig-beavail`). The drivers underlying this competition are different land-use developments in the SSPs, which are determined by agricultural productivity and global demand for food consumption.

   Availability of bioenergy at different price levels in the MESSAGE-GLOBIOM model for the three SSPs. * typically non-commercial biomass is not traded or sold, however in some cases there is a market – prices range from 0.1-1.5$/GJ (Pachauri et al., 2013 :cite:`pachauri_pathways_2013`) ($ equals 2005 USD).
