Preview of the Upcoming MESSAGEix-Materials Release

This upcoming release of MESSAGEix-Materials introduces significant enhancements to the current model.
It features improved calibration and updated parameterization, drawing on the latest statistics and findings from recent literature.
Most of these updates reflect developments made during the ScenarioMIP project.

Model changes
=============

Iron & steel sector
-------------------

*To be merged from ssp-dev*

Non metallic minerals sector
----------------------------

- Clinker input for cement production is now differentiated by region based on literature data.
- 2020 and 2025 demand calibrated based on recent statistics, independent of SSP.
- Previous fuel use calibration was updated based on most recent data.
- Growth constraints for clinker CCS capacity are differentiated by SSP.
- The energy requirement for clinker CCS was adjusted based on recent literature.

Non ferrous metals sector
-------------------------

- Trade representation for alumina has been implemented
- The aluminum has been fixed in 2025 independent of SSP setting
- The 2020 aluminum demand was slightly revised in some regions
- The energy intensity of alumina refining was revised and differentiated by region based on IAI data
- The fuel use for alumina refining in 2020 was calibrated based on IAI data
- The energy intensity of aluminum smelting was revised and differentiated by region based on IAI data
- The historical smelting capacity was calibrated based on an accurate global capacity data set
- The historical smelting and refining activity in 2020 was calibrated based on BGS statistics
- The maximum recyclable aluminum scrap ratio is now differentiated by SSP
- The heat requirement and cost for aluminum scrap preparation is now differentiated by SSP

CLI changes
===========

- The `--datafile` options has been removed from the material-ix commands, as it is no longer needed.

Deprecations
============

New features
============

The following xlsx files have been replaced by multiple csv files for each sheet to facilitate version control and readability:

- :file:`aluminum_techno_economic.xlsx`
- :file:`Global_cement_MESSAGE.xlsx`

The files are currently still available for reference, but will be removed in a future release.
