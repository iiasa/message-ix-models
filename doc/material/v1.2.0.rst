Preview of the upcoming MESSAGEix-Materials release

This upcoming release of MESSAGEix-Materials introduces significant enhancements to the current model.
It features improved calibration and updated parameterization, drawing on the latest statistics and findings from recent literature.
Most of these updates reflect developments made during the ScenarioMIP project.

Model changes
=============

Iron & steel sector
-------------------

Revisions & fixes
~~~~~~
- Added missing relation entries for maximum steel recycling rates
- Full calibration of the steel sector for 2020 and 2025, including:

  - Historical production and capacity additions for all major steel production technologies
  - Historical steel demand
- Update of techno-economic input data for several technologies to more recent or accurate literature
- Removed water commodity flows due to incompatibility with new MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM-GAINS model structure

Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~

- Explicit representation of India-specific DRI technology using rotary coal kilns
- :func:`.gen_cokeoven_co2_cc` function added to generate coke oven CO2 emission factors
- Added functionality to differentiate steel model parameterization along SSP narratives:

  - :func:`.get_scrap_prep_cost` function added to generate scrap preparation costs
  - :func:`.gen_max_recycling_rel` function added to generate maximum recycling rates
  - :func:`.gen_grow_cap_up function` added to generate growth constraints for steel CCS capacity
  - Use of :doc:`/api/tools-costs` for iron/steel production technologies
- New steel projections derived from relationship of macro-economic investment to per capita steel demand
- Regionally differentiated scrap availability from steel finishing and manufacturing based on statistics

Non metallic minerals sector
----------------------------

- Clinker input for cement production is now differentiated by region based on literature data.
- 2020 and 2025 demand calibrated based on recent statistics, independent of SSP.
- Previous fuel use calibration was updated based on most recent data.
- Growth constraints for clinker CCS capacity are differentiated by SSP.
- The energy requirement for clinker CCS was adjusted based on recent literature.

Non ferrous metals sector
-------------------------

- Trade representation for alumina has been implemented
- The aluminum has been fixed in 2025 independent of SSP setting
- The 2020 aluminum demand was slightly revised in some regions
- The energy intensity of alumina refining was revised and differentiated by region based on IAI data
- The fuel use for alumina refining in 2020 was calibrated based on IAI data
- The energy intensity of aluminum smelting was revised and differentiated by region based on IAI data
- The historical smelting capacity was calibrated based on an accurate global capacity data set
- The historical smelting and refining activity in 2020 was calibrated based on BGS statistics
- The maximum recyclable aluminum scrap ratio is now differentiated by SSP
- The heat requirement and cost for aluminum scrap preparation is now differentiated by SSP

Chemicals sector
----------------

- gen_resid_demand_NH3 modified to differentiate by SSP and fix 2025 demand
- gen_ccs_bounds function added to generate ccs bounds for ammonia in 2020 and 2025

- 2025 demand fixed independent of SSP
- gen_meth_fs_downstream function to generate new technology for methanol downstream use
- call gen_plastics_emission_factors and gen_chemicals_co2_ind_factors to generate emission factors for methanol end-of-life treatment
- added procedure to filter out relations from input file that are not in new scenario versions

- fix 2025 demand independent of SSP
- call gen_plastics_emission_factors and gen_chemicals_co2_ind_factors to generate emission factors for plastics end-of-life treatment
- call gen_ethanol_to_ethylene_emi_factor to generate negative emission factors for ethanol to ethylene conversion
- procedure to filter out year_act-year_vtg combinations that are not within the maximum lifetime of petrochemical technologies

- load_GDP_COVID removed
- add_macro_COVID renamed to add_macro_materials
- modify_demand_and_hist_activity_debug and modify_demand_and_hist_activity removed
- modify_industry_demand, calc_resid_ind_demand, calc_demand_shares, add_new_ind_hist_act, calc_hist_activity removed or moved?
- gen_te_projections extended due to tools.cost updates
- calculate_ini_new_cap extended by ssp argument to differentiate SSPs
- add_water_par_data function added to generate water parameters required for materials build
- calibrate_for_SSPs function added that contains several 2020 calibration adjustments
- gen_plastics_emission_factors, gen_chemicals_co2_ind_factors and gen_ethanol_to_ethylene_emi_factor added to generate emission factors for chemicals

CLI changes
===========

- The `--datafile` options has been removed from the material-ix commands, as it is no longer needed.

Deprecations
============

- Functionalities of :mod:`.model.material.report.reporting` was replaced by :mod:`.model.material.report.run_reporting`. *Will be removed in the next release.*

New features
============

- The following xlsx files have been replaced by multiple csv files for each sheet to facilitate version control and readability:

  - :file:`aluminum_techno_economic.xlsx`
  - :file:`Global_cement_MESSAGE.xlsx`
  - :file:`Global_steel_MESSAGE.xlsx`

  The files are currently still available for reference, but will be removed in a future release.

- New post-processing module for the industry sector in :mod:`.model.material.report.run_reporting` providing:

  - More generalized method of post-processing MESSAGEix-Materials results
  - Configuration handled through :mod:`.model.material.report.config` YAML files in :file:`material/model/material/reporting/`
  - Higher resolution of post-processed results
