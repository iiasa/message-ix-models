    """Revise hydrogen-blending constraints.

    The revision of the constraints makes changes to three relations.

    1. For relation `h2_scrub_limit`, two CCS technologies are removed.

       The relation should limit hydrogen share via blending in all non-CCS gas
       applications to 50%, hence `h2_mix` has an entry of -.482 tC/kWa * 2 * input,
       while all other technologies have an entry of .482 tC/kWa * input. Greenfield CCS
       technologies do not require an entry into the relation, as well as any other
       technologies which require the "C" for the output e.g. ``meth_ng`` or ``h2_smr``.
       A negative entry from the greenfield-CCS technologies would further reduce the
       "total" gas. Theoretically, ``gas_coal`` should also have an entry, but is not
       really necessary as this technology is only active in BAU scenarios, when this
       constraint is not active. ``bio_gas`` has a negative entry to ensure that it
       doesn't count towards the total used to derive the share. The retro-fit CCS
       scrubbers require an entry, because the gas used in powerplants to which the
       retrofits apply, can be used for CCS purposes and this needs to be avoided. Only
       secondary-level technologies need to be added.
    2. The relation `h2mix_direct` is removed in favor of #3. This avoids having to add
       individual technologies at the final-energy level.
    3. The relation `gas_mix_lim` is used to limit the share of hydrogen blended into
       the natural-gas network based on total final-energy gas use. Previously, this
       constraint was only configured for AFR (at 20%). The constraint is carried over
       to other regions and set at 50% in all regions including AFR.
