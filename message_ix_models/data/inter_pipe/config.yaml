# Configuration for message_data.tools.utilities.generate_inter_pipe
# Fill in the config to generate bare sheets to collect inter pipe data

# Put the scenario information here
scenario:
  start_model: MISSING  # e.g. "SSP_SSP2_v6.1"
  start_scen: MISSING  # e.g. "baseline_DEFAULT"
  target_model: MISSING  # e.g. "MixG_GEIDCO5_SSP2_v6.1"
  target_scen: MISSING  # e.g. "Base_RCP7_int_noIBWT" or "EN1000f_RCP26_int_noIBWT" for mitigation scenario

# How many nodes are there?
# nodes:
#   - R11
#   - R12
#   - R5 
# Except R5, determined by the nodes in the start_scen. 

# How would you name the pipe technologies?
# The pipe technology is the technology that is used to transport the commodity from one node to another.
