# this file provides data about the primary chemicals
# needed to calculate emission factors and embodied carbon

# "plastic use" describes the estimated downstream use in long-lived products (= plastics)
# estimate is based on material flow data from Levi & Cullen chemicals MFA study
# calculations are documented in "HVC plastic shares.xlsx" (currently stored on maczek OneDrive)
# TODO: insert proper literature reference to paper and store xlsx file on a central repo
