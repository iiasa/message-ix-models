title: MESSAGEix-Transport inputs
description: |-
  These data are ingested by the setup/calibration code for MESSAGEix-Transport.
  This code takes an instance ("scenario") of the MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM global model
  and alters it to add the detailed transport structure.

  See the description `messageix-transport-core.yaml` for the data in the core
  model formulation. Data that exactly matches the core formulation can also be
  used as input; this file describes non-core data that can be transformed/used
  with existing code & methods.

  This setup code was originally developed for use with data from the US-TIMES
  and MA³T models.

dimension:
  time:
    scope: historical (1990-2020) to 2100
    resolution: 5- or 10-year periods, or annual
    description: Data at <5 year resolution can be aggregated.
  space:
    scope: global
    resolution: country or R11 regions
    description: Data at the country resolution can be aggregated.
  census_division:
    scope: Continental United States
    resolution: 9 census regions, or total
    description: >-
      Census divisons of the United States. This is used to map data from
      US-TIMES and MA³T.
  area_type:
    scope: all areas within a given spatial unit
    resolution: >-
      3-point scale: urban, suburban, or rural.
    description: Urbanization or urban form of a sub-national area.
  attitude:
    scope: all people in a given (sub-)population
    resolution: >-
      3-point scale: early adopter, early majority, late majority
    description: >-
      New technology adoption attitude or propensity, in particular towards new
      transport technologies, modes, options, etc.
  driver_type:
    scope: all vehicle drivers in a given (sub-)population
    resolution: >-
      3-point scale: moderate, average, frequent
    description: >-
      The amount of annual driving done by a person, relative to others in the
      population.
  consumer_group:
    scope: all people in a given population
    resolution: 27-point scale; see description
    description: |-
      Group of people within a population that have similar transport demand/
      activity, behaviour, etc. characteristics. In MESSAGEix-Transport, this is
      operationalized as the Cartesian product of the `area_type`, `attitude`,
      and `driver_type` concepts/dimensions.

      E.g. the label "RUEMF" means the subset of people who live in rural
      areas ("RU"), have early majority ("EM") technology attitudes, and are
      frequent drivers ("F").
  mode:
    scope: the points listed below; excluding e.g. pipelines
    resolution: >-
      5-point scale: air, bus, rail, LDV, 2-3 wheelers
    description: |-
      Mode or medium of passenger transport. In the MESSAGEix-Transport setup
      code, this is operationalized in a way that includes both different
      vehicle types (e.g. bus, LDV, 2W+3W) and the `mode` concept in the iTEM
      sense (e.g. "Road" for all 3 of these).
  technology:
    scope: All transport technologies
    description: The powertrain technology of a transport vehicle.
    resolution: |-
      43 distinct labels. Some of these are only valid in combination with
      certain other values for the `mode` dimension. In particular, the number
      of labels is:

      - Rail: 6
      - 2-3 wheelers: 2
      - LDV: 12
      - Aviation: 4
      - Bus: 10

      As well, for freight road (not included in the `mode` dimension, above),
      there are 9 `technology` labels.

measure:
  population:
    description: Count of people in a given area or category.
  disutility cost:
    description: >-
      Monetary equivalent to the intangible/non-monetary disutility
      (‘inconvenience’, etc.) that a person has towards using a specific
      technology; separate from the real, monetary costs of obtaining or using
      that technology.
  travel speed:
    description: Average travel speed by a particular means of transport.

quantity:
- measure: population
  dimensions: [time, space, consumer_group]
  units: persons
  description: >-
    With these dimensions, this data captures the "shares" or division of the
    total population across the consumer groups.

- measure: disutility cost
  dimensions: [time, space, technology, consumer_group]
  units: USD_2015
  description: >-
    These data only cover the 12 `technology` labels associated with the LDV
    `mode`.

- measure: travel speed
  dimensions: [time, space, mode]
  units: km/h
  description: >-
    The code uses the assumption that travel speeds are the same for every
    `technology` with the same `mode`.
