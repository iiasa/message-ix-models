title: Materials + transport representation in MESSAGEix
description: |-
  These are the data required to parametrize a representation of materials use
  in the transport sector, i.e. the integration of MESSAGEix-Materials and
  MESSAGEix-Transport.

      Historical data (1990-2020) + projections. This is aligned with XM's approach.
      In this case, from 1990 to 2010 the additions, capacity etc., will be 0
      due to the lack of EVs and PHEVs in the fleet. Data from 2010 to 2020 based on 
      historical yearly statistics.

  powertrain_type:
    scope: All powertrain technologies  
    resolution: Powertrain technologies included in MESSAGEix (ICEV,BEV,PHEV,FCEV) 
    description: |-
      Even though for this analysis only PHEV and BEVs are relevant, 
      we should probably take into account all powertrain technologies

    scope: BEVs and PHEVs
    description: Battery technology/chemistry that can be used by electric vehicles
    resolution: |-
      Three families of battery chemistries for current fleet of vehicles (NCA, NMC, LFP)
      Possibly, think about two battery chemistries that may be used in the future. Candidates:
        - Li-air
        - Li-S 
  vehicle_segment: 
    scope: size of ELDVs
    description: The vehicle class , which will affect the battery size 
    resolution: |-
      Confirm with Paul which vehicle segments are available in MESSAGEix-Transport
      I suppose: micro, medium, SUV. I might be wrong. To each vehicle segment
      a given battery size has to be assigned, based on current real fleet data
      and then projected until 2050
  material_type: 
    scope: Relevant materials used in Li-ion batteries
    resolution: |-
      4-point scale: Lithium, Cobalt, Nickel, Graphite. These are the 4 materials
      of interest, however it may be necessary to include also copper, since in one pathway
      Co is a by-product of Cu extraction.

    description: size of battery per vehicle segment and battery technology
material_intensity:
  description: Amount of material required per kWh of storage capacity in each battery type

quantity:
- measure: battery_size
  dimensions: [time,space,powertrain_type,vehicle segment]
  units: kWh
  description: |-
    Size of the battery, measured in kWh, for a given combination of powertrain technology
    and vehicle size.

- measure: material_intensity
  dimensions: [time, battery_technology, material_type]
  units: kg/kWh
  description: |- 
    This captures the material intensity (Li,Co,Ni,C) of the different battery technologies 
    analysed per kWh of storage capacity.
