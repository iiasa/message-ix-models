title: MESSAGEix-Transport model core
description: |-
  These are the data represented in the model core of MESSAGEix-Transport. This
  model uses the same, generic MESSAGE mathematical formulation as the
  MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM global model (without transport detail), and so this data
  description also applies to other instances ("scenarios") of that model.

  All of the core data are available directly as output, as well as aggregated
  and derived quantities.

  [Choose one: “For derived output quantities, see the separate `....yaml`.”
  OR “In this file, derived output quantities are denoted with [...].”]

- measure: freight activity
  kind: core

  description: >-
    For freight truck `technology` only.

- measure: passenger activity
  kind: core
  dimensions: [time, space, mode, technology]
  description: >-
    For non-LDV `mode` only. For these modes & technologies, there is no
    distinction by `consumer_group`.

- measure: passenger activity
  kind: core
  dimensions: [time, space, technology, consumer_group]
  description: >-
    For LDV `technology` only. The model core optimizes the activity of each
    `consumer_group` by each `LDV` technology.
