title: Materials + transport representation in MESSAGEix
description: |-
  These are the data required to parametrize a representation of materials use
  in the transport sector, i.e. the integration of MESSAGEix-Materials and
  MESSAGEix-Transport.

classifiers:
- "Kind :: Model input"

dimension:
  time:
    scope: 1990 to 2100
    resolution: 5- or 10-year periods or annual
    description: >-
      Up until 2022, data reflect real-world measurements. From 2022 (or other
      start year) onwards, data are projections.
  space:
    scope: global
    resolution: country or vehicle market/manufacturing region.
    description: It would be best if the Chinese data could be included.
  vehicle_type:
    scope: all classification of vehicles
    resolution: : >-
      3-point scale: Passenger LDV, bus, truck
    description: >-
      More detailed classification of the above 3 types is welcomed, e.g.
      separating size classes of LDVs (cars, small or large; SUVs, etc.),
      trucks, etc.
  make_model:
    scope: any available
    resolution: any specific make and model
    description: >-
      Specific manufacturer and model of vehicle.
  fuel_type:
    scope: all classification of vehicles by the fuel & technology they use
    resolution: : >-
      10-point scale: gasoline, diesel, electricity, hydrogen,
      compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, coal-derived methanol,
      bio-diesel, coal-to-liquids, bio-ethanol
    description: >-
      Not all fuel types are necessarily included for each specific model.
      Materials intensities of specific components may be the same across
      different fuel_type if these components are essentially the same.
  powertrain_type:
    scope: all classification of vehicles by the powertrain
    resolution: ICE, PHEV, BEV, etc.
    description: Different fuel_type may eventually correspond to one powertrain_type
  material_type:
    scope: all common materials used in vehicles
    resolution: : >-
      14-point scale: steel, copper, aluminum, lithium, cobalt, nickel,
      neodymium, dysprosium, platinum, plastics, composite material, coal, crude oil, natural gas.
    description: >-
      Other material can also be added depend on the available data.
  component:
    scope: all major components in vehicles
    resolution: : >-
      7-point scale: body structure, wheels and tires, chassis,
      powertrain system, energy storage battery, hydrogen on-board storage,
      fuel cell
    description: >-
      Vehicles of a particular type and fuel type do not have to contain all of
      the above components, e.g. “hydrogen on-board storage” is not relevant for
      “electric vehicle”.

measure:
  material_intensity_1:
    description: >-
      Mass of a given material required for one unit of component production defined by 
      vehicle_type and powertrain_type.

  material_intensity_2:
    description: >-
      Mass of a given material required for one unit of component production defined by 
      make_model.

  material_intensity_energy:
    description: >-
      Mass of upstream materials required to provide different
      types of fuels used in vehicles.

  sales:
    description: >-
      Vehicle sales for certain make_model.


quantity:
- measure: material_intensity_1
  dimensions: [time, space, vehicle_type, powertrain_type, material_type, component]
  units: tons per vehicle
  description: >-
    With these dimensions, this data captures the material intensity of major
    components of certain vehicle type and powertrain type.
    If a vehicle includes more than one of a certain component, then this is
    the total across the components in a single vehicle.

- measure: material_intensity_2
  dimensions: [time, space, make_model, material_type, component]
  units: tons per unit component
  description: >-
    With these dimensions, this data captures the material intensity of major
    components of certain make_model.
    If a vehicle includes more than one of a certain component, then this is
    the total across the components in a single vehicle.

- measure: material_intensity_energy
  dimensions: [time, space, fuel_type, material_type]
  units: tons per unit energy
  description: >-
    This captures the upstream requirements for materials to provide different
    types of fuels used in vehicles.

- measure: sales
  dimensions: [time, space, make_model]
  units: vehicles per year
  description: >-
    This would be used to calculate a sales-weighted average across materials
    intensities that are specific to different make_model.
