# Cost reduction in 2100,,,,,
# ,,,,,
# Units: %  ,,,,,
#,,,,,
# Data is copied from Sheet1 in https://github.com/iiasa/message_data/blob/dev/data/model/investment_cost/SSP_technology_learning.xlsx,,,,,
# There are some manually changed assumptions to the original GEA data in the spreadsheet (can be seen in the spreadsheet as marked in yellow),,,,,
# The initial copied data can be found in gea_reduction_rates.csv,,,,,
# This file renames the learning rates from GEAL to low and GEAM to medium and GEAH to high,,,,,
