#    "EMEP_EEA Emission factor.xlsx". These all have the following
#    dimensions/metadata in other columns:
#    - NFR: 1.A.3.a.ii.(i)
#    - Sector: Civil aviation (domestic, LTO)
#      → technology=AIR
#    - Table: Table_3-3
#    - Type: Tier 1 Emission Factor
#    - Technology: NA
#    - Fuel: Jet Gasoline and Aviation Gasoline
#    - Abatement: (empty)
#    - Region: NA
#    - Pollutant → emission
#    - CI_lower, CI_upper, Reference → preserved as comments
#    - Unit: kg/tonne fuel, which is equivalent to g / kg fuel.

#    The units for these are kt/petajoule gasoline with [=] g / MJ.
# 4. Estimated as the ratio of CEDS data for y=2019 and MESSAGEix-Transport
#    final energy use. The CEDS data use:
#    - the code “Sulfur” with units “Mt SO2/yr”.
#    - the code “NOx” with units “Mt NO2/yr”.
