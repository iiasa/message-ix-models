# Mode shares of freight activity in the model base year
#
# - Prepared by A. Javaid 2023-11-02.
# - LAM data is based on weight (tones) as I havenâ€™t yet found any good
#   source for tonne-km mode split.
# - LAM and SSA mode split are based on intra-regional movements, whereas
#   others are either total within a region or total within a country.
# - PNK inserted "0" for:
#   - mode=AIR in R11_EEU, R11_FSU.
#   - mode=WATER in R11_MEA, R11_NAM.
#
# Units: dimensionless
