# Technologies in MESSAGEix-Transport
#
# - Some of these codes still repeat those used for transport technologies in
#   the MESSAGE V version of MESSAGE-Transport. Some note the reference:
#   “The "GEAM_TRP_techinput.xls" workbook ("updateTRPdata" sheet) in
#   Christoph's folders.”
#
# Codes have the following annotations:
#
# - 'gfei-2017-technology': Originally added to message_data.tools.iea_eei;
#   moved here in iiasa/message_data#549 / iiasa/message-ix-models#162. Comments
#   from the original location by F. Lovat:
#
#   - Flexfuel: Reference is ICEs vehicles using methanol/synthetic fossil
#     liquids.
#   - Missing in the mapping: ICE_L_ptrp, IGH_ghyb.
#   - TODO: Deal with diesel (at the moment assumed to be ICE using biofuels)
#     and LPG powertrains (so far, it is ICE_lpg, not present in
#     MESSAGEix-Transport). Also, category "Hybrid" should be extended to the
#     list of three modes: ICH_chyb, IAHe_ptrp, IAHm_ptrp.
#
# - 'input': same as in message-ix-models: mapping including 'commodity' and/or
#   'level' keys indicating the technology's inputs.
# - 'message-v-report': these appeared in the US-TIMES–MA³T input data, but were
#   apparently not used in MESSAGE-(V)-Transport.
# - 'report': are picked up by add_replacements() for reporting.
