# This file describes a possible set of base technologies to be used in the
# global model. It will be usable by both model creation and reporting code.
#
# Each entry includes the following fields:
# - name, description: required.
# - sector: a label to group multiple technologies to a notional sector.
#   Required.
# - output (required) and input (optional): either
#   - a list of [commodity, level] giving the output generated or input used by
#     the technology; or,
#   - a list of 2 or more such lists, if the technology has multiple inputs or
#     outputs.
# - vintaged: True if the technology's properties vary by year_vintage.
#   Optional; False if omitted.
# - type: In the Excel file used to create this YAML file (see
#   https://github.com/iiasa/message_data/issues/74), 'type' appears to be
#   always the same as 'output'/level; *unless* the 'output'/commodity is a
#   dummy commodity, in which case it is 'dummy'.
#
#   TODO if this is the case, remove 'type' from this file, and generate 'type'
#        in tools.technologies.get_info.
