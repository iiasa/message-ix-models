"""GEIDCO project module.

This module contains scripts and utilities for the GEIDCO project, which focuses on
modeling global energy interconnection scenarios with ultra-high voltage (UHV)
transmission technologies.

The main functionality includes:
- Building baseline scenarios with inter-pipe technologies
- Running GEIDCO-specific model configurations
- Generating reports for GEIDCO scenarios

Available scripts:
- :file:`run_baseline.py`: Main script to build and run the GEIDCO baseline scenario
