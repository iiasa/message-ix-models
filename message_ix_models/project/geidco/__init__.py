This module contains scripts and utilities for the GEIDCO project, which focuses on
modeling global energy interconnection scenarios with ultra-high voltage (UHV)
transmission technologies.

The main functionality includes:

- Building baseline scenarios with :mod:`.inter_pipe` technologies.
- Running GEIDCO-specific model configurations.
- Generating reports for GEIDCO scenarios.

Available scripts:

- :file:`run_baseline.py`: Main script to build and run the GEIDCO baseline scenario.
