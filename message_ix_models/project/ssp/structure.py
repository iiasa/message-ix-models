This code list is *not* officially published by ICONICS; rather, it is a rendering into
SDMX of structural information that is provided by ICONICS participants. It may change
or be superseded at any time.

Each code has a single digit ID like "1"; the "original-id" annotation (and the start of
the name) give a string like "SSP1". These original IDs are *only* unique if using data
enumerated by solely by one code list or the other; if mixing the two, then they will be
ambiguous. The URNs of the codes or parts thereof (for instance, "ICONICS:SSP(2017).1")

demographic transition, and the emphasis on economic growth shifts toward a broader
emphasis on human well-being. Driven by an increasing commitment to achieving

shift markedly from historical patterns. Development and income growth proceeds
unevenly, with some countries making relatively good progress while others fall short of
expectations. Global and national institutions work toward but make slow progress in
achieving sustainable development goals. Environmental systems experience degradation,
although there are some improvements and overall the intensity of resource and energy
use declines. Global population growth is moderate and levels off in the second half of

security issues. Countries focus on achieving energy and food security goals within
their own regions at the expense of broader-based development. Investments in education
and technological development decline. Economic development is slow, consumption is
material-intensive, and inequalities persist or worsen over time. Population growth is

Highly unequal investments in human capital, combined with increasing disparities in
economic opportunity and political power, lead to increasing inequalities and
stratification both across and within countries. Over time, a gap widens between an
internationally-connected society that contributes to knowledge- and capital-intensive
sectors of the global economy, and a fragmented collection of lower-income, poorly
educated societies that work in a labor intensive, low-tech economy. Social cohesion
degrades and conflict and unrest become increasingly common. Technology development is
high in the high-tech economy and sectors. The globally connected energy sector
diversifies, with investments in both carbon-intensive fuels like coal and
unconventional oil, but also low-carbon energy sources. Environmental policies focus on
local issues around middle and high income areas.""",

are also strong investments in health, education, and institutions to enhance human and
social capital. At the same time, the push for economic and social development is
coupled with the exploitation of abundant fossil fuel resources and the adoption of
resource and energy intensive lifestyles around the world. All these factors lead to
rapid growth of the global economy, while global population peaks and declines in the
21st century. Local environmental problems like air pollution are successfully managed.
